## Todo-List

A basic Todo-List built using the JavaScript, Html, CSS. It allows users to keep track of tasks they need to complete. It typically consists of an input field where users can type in a task and press the enter button to add the task to the list. Each task is displayed as an item in a list, along with options to mark tasks as completed and delete them.
